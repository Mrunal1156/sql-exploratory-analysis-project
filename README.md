## 📋 Script Requirements

### SQL Exploration & Data Profiling

#### Objective
Develop a series of SQL scripts to understand database structure, validate data integrity, and generate foundational insights for analytics.

#### Specifications
- **00.information_schema**: Explore tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships to understand the database structure.
- **01.database_exploration**: Perform initial profiling such as row counts, table summaries, and general data checks.
- **02.dimension_exploration**: Analyze dimension tables (Customer, Product, Date) for completeness, consistency, and correctness.
- **03.date_range_exploration**: Validate date ranges, identify gaps, and ensure temporal accuracy.
- **04.measure_exploration**: Explore business measures such as sales, revenue, and quantity to ensure accuracy before analytics.
- **05.magnitude_analysis**: Assess value distributions to detect outliers, anomalies, and unusual variations.
- **06.ranking_analysis**: Generate ranking-based insights (top customers, products, categories) using SQL window functions.
